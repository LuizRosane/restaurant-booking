    <p>Welcome to My Imaginary Bistro, where reality meets imagination!</p>

    <br />

    <p>
      Our restaurant is a portfolio scenario and doesn't actually exist. It's a
      creative project to showcase design and development skills. This
      application is like a recipe, among ingredients there are Vue.js,
      Bootstrap, Git, AWS Amplify, AWS SES AWS Dynamo, AWS Cognito, AWS Appsync
      and other technologies.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      The main features to implemented in this project is a booking system in
      which clients book a table and get an email confirmation. The application
      must also have a login system where the staff can manage bookings. The
      whole application is built in the AWS cloud environment in order to
      exercise, review and learn more about cloud architecture and cloud based
      development
